  description: "Husks are physical manifestations of the souls of the damned; the
    higher the value, the higher the power. But this raises the question: what happens
    when the soul is too dim to generate a husk? The answer to that question is the
    Revenant. \n\nOnce living a life ruled by hopelessness, sadness and misery, a
    Revenant's soul was unable to fully manifest even once they finally embraced
    death - leaving them forever trapped, phasing between time and space. Now cursed
    with this ultimate punishment, they simply find a sadistic pleasure in torturing
    any soul they come into contact with. \n\nThey are recognized as husks that managed
    to escape hell, and are mostly mistaken for ghosts in many cultures. \n\nIf you
    come in contact with one, make sure to not stare."
  strategy: '- Revenants are able to make themselves impercievable to cameras, and
    therefore, most machines. Expect an ambush from all directions.


    - The light
    on their faces are a mirror into their broken souls - while a human would go
    insane when staring at it, machines instead experience interference in their
    vision. You can tell their proximity based on the strength of the disturbance.


    -
    They like to play, and see the Marksman as cheating in their game. If hit with
    a coin, they will become enraged, increasing their attack speed.


    - Many
    attacks can be parried; but the stomp attack will reflect the Revenant, and stun
    it if it hits a wall. This also deals great damage.


    - As its projectiles
    bounce, you have several chances to parry them for a full heal.'
